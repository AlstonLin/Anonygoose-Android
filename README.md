# anonygoose-Android

IMPORTANT: ANONYGOOSE WAS MADE FOR TERRIBLE HACK

This means that anonygoose was not meant to be an actually good app:
  - The UI is meant to be terrible
  - The security is meant to be terrible
  - No one on the anonygoose team actually thinks comic sans is a good font

We're not just *that* bad at programming
